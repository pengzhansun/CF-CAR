## Introduction
Recent action recognition models may tend to rely on object appearance as a shortcut and thus fail to sufficiently learn the real action knowledge.

On the one hand, we find that object appearance is the bias which cheats the model to make the wrong prediction because of different action classes it co-appears between the training stage and test stage. On the other hand, the object appearance is a meaningful cue which can help the model to learn the knowledge of action.

So we propose Counterfactual Debiasing Network (CDN) to remove the bad object appearance bias while keep the good object appearance cue for action recognition.

## Task Setting
There are two disjoint action sets _\{1, 2\}_ and two disjoint object sets _\{A, B\}_. For the compositional action recognition task, the training set of the model is _\{1A + 2B\}_, and the verification set is _\{1B + 2A\}_. Under this challenging setting, the model needs to be able to recognize new combinations of actions and objects. In this problem setting, there are 174 action categories with 54,919 training and 57,876 validation instances. More details can be found in Something-Else.

## Idea
We empower models the ability of counterfactual analysis so that a more accurate classification result can be gained by comparing factual inference outcome and counterfactual inference outcome.

## Contributions
1. We observe that prior knowledge learned from appearance information is mixed with the spurious correlation between action and instance appearance, which badly inhibits the modelâ€™s ability of action learning.

2. We remove the pure appearance effect from total effect by counterfactual debiasing inference on our novel framework CDN proposed for compositional action recognition.

3. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for compositional action recognition on the Something-Else dataset.
